      <h1>Primary Characters</h1>
      <p>
        Primary characters are the big ones: the hero/protagonist, the
        villain/antagonist, the main viewpoint character.<br />These are the
        characters the reader identifies as the ones the story is about.
      </p>

          <img src="images/Bojji.png" />
          <h3>Bojji</h3>
          <p>
            The main protagonist of the story and the first prince of the
            Kingdom of Bosse. Born deaf and tiny in size, he was ridiculed and
            scorned openly by many within the palace and kingdom. Despite his
            disability, Bojji dreams of becoming a strong king like his father
            and always tries to maintain a smile in front of others. He is known
            for his kindness, which has earned him many unexpected allies,
            diligence, and intuition, which allows him to read lips and know
            what people are saying. He also possesses extreme agility and
            dodging ability unconventional for kings that tend to rely on
            strength, and impervious to poison. Following Daida's coronation, he
            and Kage set off on a journey.

          <h3>Kage</h3>
          <p>
            A last surviving member of the shadow clan and Bojji's companion.
            Born to a clan of assassins, Kage was a young child when he
            witnessed his entire family murdered by the kingdom they served. He
            subsequently escaped and was exploited by a thug, who eventually
            sold him out for his ransom. Tempered by the rough way of the world,
            Kage then grew up using his clan's abilities to make a living off
            thieving. He eventually meets Bojji and is touched by his kindness
            and his situation, pledging to be his faithful friend. He is tasked
            by Bebin to follow and protect Bojji on their journey.

          <img src="images/Daida.png" />
          <h3>Daida</h3>
          <p>
            Bojji's younger half-brother, the birth son of Queen Hiling and the
            current king. Like Bojji he is hardworking and resilient, but
            possesses a streak of pride and arrogance in his strength that seems
            to take after their father. Deep down, he is secretly jealous of his
            brother, whom he believes was able to get everyone's love and the
            position of king without any effort. In the time leading up to his
            coronation, Daida is manipulated by a Magic Mirror and is forcibly
            made the vessel for Bosse's reincarnation.

      <h1>Supporting Characters</h1>
      <p>
        A supporting character is a character that is not the focus of the
        primary storyline, but appears or is mentioned in the story enough<br />
        to be more than just a minor character. Sometimes, supporting characters
        may develop a complex backstory of their own,<br />
        but this is usually in relation to the main character, rather than
        entirely independently.
