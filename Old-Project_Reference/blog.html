          <h2>First Impressions</h2>
          <p>
            What is strength? It’s a big question with a multitude of potential
            answers. I think about those answers a lot, because the question of
            what constitutes a strong character has been debated time and time
            again as I’ve grown up and further into anime fandom. I’ve spoken
            before about the many panels I’ve attended and in which I’ve
            participated which purport to discuss what a “strong female
            character” in particular actually is, and it’s my perennial
            dissatisfaction with those answers that has kept me focused on
            studying the non traditional solutions to that characterization
            dilemma. In short, physical strength is only one part of the puzzle,
            and not even a necessary one; oftentimes it’s the various other
            flavors of human “strength” – emotional, ethical, supportive or even
            one’s own self-esteem – that speaks more to me as a viewer.

            Bojji is the type of character that exemplifies what I’m talking
            about. It takes strength to withstand the type of bullying he deals
            with, and further strength to avoid becoming hardened and bitter
            from it. People excuse their own bad behavior by telling themselves
            that the target of their ill-intent can’t understand what they’re
            saying anyway, but it doesn’t take a sense of hearing to feel the
            hot, hostile stares of others, or to sense the maliciousness of what
            they’re saying exhibited in their body language. I worked with a
            deaf woman many years ago, and one thing that she said that always
            stuck with me was that hearing people “lied” – their body language
            and the look on their face often ran contrary to what they were
            saying with their words. Bojji isn’t stupid – he knows what people
            are saying. But he saves his crying for when he’s alone, in a
            heartbreaking example of what it takes to survive in an emotionally
            hostile environment. I’ve been there, too.

            But if swordplay is the language that the other characters will
            understand, well, there’s more than one way to play that game as
            well. While the world we’re in may sometimes worship brute force as
            a way to solve all problems, nimble light-footed nuance is often the
            more effective (and accessible!) way of handling things. Bojji may
            not be gifted with the sword, but he does seem to be quick and
            athletic in a way that’s unusual enough to surprise his foes (and
            which has allowed him to avoid attack by snakes… perhaps an earlier
            assassination attempt? I don’t want to think about the implications
            of that too hard right now, yikes).

            Kindness, gentleness, emotional intelligence, these are all things
            that, at one time or another, were and are considered forms of
            weakness. It pleases me that, at least on it surface and one episode
            in, this series seems to be poised to position them as the strengths
            they deserver to be categorized as.
